## Project for West Windsor Park 

https://emilyliu1059.github.io/wwp-parks/

The goal for my project was to create a unique page for each of my township's parks that included images of the park and any necessary information about the park for new/returning visitors.

I led a team of girl scouts to visit each park where we took pictures of the park and its facilities. These images were then compiled into a carnival slideshow on the web page.

One of the issues I faced during this process was that the file size of the images taken on my phone were too large and hence caused the page render to be extremely slow. I used GIMP to reduce the size of the image to make the load time of the page shorter.

The initial work that I created for 12 parks for West Windsor Township is located on https://emilywwp.github.io/. This can no longer be accessed so I replicated it to this repository.
